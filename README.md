# Sign Copy
Sign Copy is a simple Minecraft Fabric mod that allows you to copy
text from signs in-game, and apply the copied text to another sign (1.20+).

## Usage

#### v1.0.2 and Later

- Sneak and right-click on a sign (both hands must be empty). The text will be
copied internally, allowing you to insert it into another sign. Any existing
text will be overwritten.

#### v1.0.1

- Right-click on a sign with an empty main hand. The text will be
automatically copied to your clipboard, so you can paste it with CTRL+V
